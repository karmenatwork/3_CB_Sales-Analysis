# Sales Analysis

## Project Statement:
AAL has been a well-known name in Australia, particularly recognized for its clothing business since 2000. The company serves diverse demographics, including kids, women, men, and seniors, and has established branches across various states in Australia, encompassing metropolises as well as tier-1 and tier-2 cities.

Currently experiencing a surge in business, AAL is actively pursuing expansion opportunities. To facilitate informed investment decisions, the CEO has assigned the responsibility to the Head of Sales and Marketing (S&M) at AAL. The specific tasks include:

1. Identify the states that are generating the highest revenues.
2. Develop sales programs for states with lower revenues. The Head of Sales and Marketing has requested your assistance with this task.

Analyze the sales data of the company for the fourth quarter in Australia, examining it on a state-by-state basis. Provide insights to assist the company in making data-driven decisions for the upcoming year.
